"""`holt next`: the simple rule that won ships as measured, with its numbers.

The elaborate weighted scorer was cut for failing to beat `path_overlap`
(hit@10 0.211 vs 0.234); what ships is the measured rule, byte-identical in
semantics to the harness's predicate, and the renderer prints the measurement
with every ranking so no code path can show the order without its numbers.
