"""An evidence-matched baseline: one prompt, everything Holt sees.

The original baseline reads a README and repository metadata. Holt reads two
hundred pull request threads. Comparing them measures mostly "pull request
history beats a landing page", which is true but is not the claim the
architecture is making.

This baseline closes that gap. It receives the *same* arithmetic signals Holt
computes and the *same* twelve-thread digest Stage C reads, and is asked for the
same three-valued verdict in a single call. What differs is only the
architecture: one model call decides, instead of typed findings passing through
verification into a model-free verdict function.

If Holt does not beat this, the pipeline is not earning its complexity, and that
is worth knowing and publishing.

outside developer -- someone with no prior connection to the project -- to spend \

You are given the repository's README, its metadata, arithmetic measured from its
pull request history before the cutoff, and a sample of its pull request threads.

Judge what a merged contribution here actually *is*. A repository where merged
work means appending an entry to a catalogue -- package manifests, domain
records, plugin listings -- is easy to contribute to and is not a place to spend
a week writing software.

Answer with one of three verdicts:
  viable                 an outsider could realistically land a meaningful change
  not_viable             an outsider could not, or the work would not be software
  insufficient_evidence  the material does not support a call either way

Prefer insufficient_evidence to a confident guess. Cite evidence ids you were
given for the reasons you list."""
