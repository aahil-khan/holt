"""Where outsider work actually landed, and where it never did.

Every pull request Holt reads carries its file list. Until now that list was used
for exactly one thing -- deciding whether a diff was substantial enough to count
-- and then discarded. This counts it instead.

The output is the sentence a newcomer most needs and cannot get anywhere:
*in a tree of two hundred thousand files, these three directories are where
strangers' work has actually been merged, and these are where strangers tried and
never succeeded.* GitHub does not show it, CONTRIBUTING does not say it, and it is
not inferable from stars, issue labels or commit frequency.

**It ranks nothing and predicts nothing.** After five capabilities cut for losing
to a cheap comparator, that is deliberate: there is no ordering to be beaten here,
only a count of what happened. Arithmetic over evidence already in hand, no model
call, and nothing that could disagree with the verdict.

Read `attempted but never landed` carefully -- it is a description of this
sample, not a prohibition. A directory can appear there because outsiders are
turned away from it, or because only two people ever tried.
