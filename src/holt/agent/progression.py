"""Personalised contribution discovery: what should *this* person do next here?

The ranking is arithmetic. The model does not order anything.

That separation is the point rather than an implementation detail. `find_paths`,
the prototype this replaces, put the whole ranking inside one prompt, so when it
failed to beat GitHub's `good first issue` label there was no way to see *why* --
whether it was ignoring contributor history, weighting the wrong thing, or simply
guessing. Here every rank is a weighted sum of named features, `explain()` prints
the vector that produced it, and the model appears in exactly two places that
cannot move a result:

  * `profile()` -- one call per contributor, turning their merged pull requests
    and the review feedback on them into a competence profile. It feeds exactly
    one feature term out of eight.
  * `describe()` -- prose for the top few, after the order is fixed.

`holt_arith` (no model at all) against `holt_full` (with the profile term) is
therefore a clean measurement of whether the model adds anything over arithmetic.

Weights are fixed in `eval/PREREGISTRATION-3.md`, written before this file
existed, and are never fitted to the outcome.
