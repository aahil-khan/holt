"""The cat, its moods, and the colour it wears today.

One line, one kaomoji, no block art — so the mascot costs zero vertical space
and can sit in a masthead or a status line without a layout of its own.

**The face is not decoration, because it reports state.** Each mood below is
tied to something the engine actually decided: a run in progress, a verdict, a
claim Stage D removed. That is the whole justification for it being here — a
mascot that only looked nice would be the one element in an interface built on
"colour and shape carry meaning" that carried none.

Animation works the same way. The cat blinks slowly at rest and looks about
while a run is going, so motion means *something is happening* exactly as the
stage spinner does. Nothing loops to be lively.

The accent is chosen fresh each launch. That is deliberate and it is the only
colour in the app allowed to be arbitrary: it identifies a *session*, not a
state, so it is drawn from cool hues that cannot be mistaken for the verdict
green, the clay of a negative verdict, the red of a dropped claim, or the teal
of a resolvable evidence id. Those five keep their meanings whatever the cat is
wearing today.
