"""Choosing which model answers, and finding out whether it can.

`holt models` on the command line takes a provider and a model id and trusts you
to know both. An interface can do better: ask the provider what it actually has,
and try a real call before you find out mid-run that the endpoint is down.

Everything here is Textual-free and synchronous, so it can be tested without a
terminal and run on a worker thread by the screen that uses it. Nothing in this
file decides *what a model costs* or *what the defaults are* — `holt.model` owns
both, and this asks it.

Two facts this module exists to keep in front of the user:

* **A non-default configuration breaks replay of the committed recordings.**
  Those were recorded under the pinned ids, and the engine fails loudly rather
  than serving another model's answers. That is correct behaviour and it is not
  a surprise anybody should get later.
* **An unpriced model records cost as zero.** Not "free" — unknown. The
  interface says so wherever a price would otherwise appear.

Only models that can hold a conversation are offered. Every stage of the engine
calls `chat.completions`, so an embedding or reranking model listed here is not
a choice, it is a trap — Ollama in particular serves `nomic-embed-text` from the
same `/v1/models` as everything else, and picking it fails at the first stage
with a message about the model not supporting generate. What is filtered out is
counted and reported rather than silently dropped.
