Every meaningful experiment gets an entry: what was tried, why, the evidence, and
what was decided. Experiments that were removed are included — what they taught
us about the problem is part of the result.

## Baseline — L0, the naive outsider merge rate (2026-08-29)

**Tried.** The metric a reasonable engineer writes first: of the pull requests
outsiders opened after the cutoff, what fraction merged? No filter on what the
diff touches, no bot exclusion, no requirement a human reviewed anything.
Outsider status derived from pre-cutoff merges only. Run over the hash-committed
pool of 30 repositories (sha256 `f100b2209c…`, seed 20260601).

**Why.** The project's central claim is that naive activity metrics reward the
wrong thing. That claim is worth nothing unless the naive metric is built
faithfully and actually run.

**Evidence.** 22 repositories scored, 5 insufficient evidence, 3 unavailable.

| Rank | Rate | Merged / Tried | Repo |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0.84 | 392 / 464 | `runelite/plugin-hub` |
| 3 | 0.81 | 271 / 336 | `DefiLlama/dimension-adapters` |
| 5 | 0.70 | 26 / 37 | `Homebrew/homebrew-cask` |
| 8 | 0.57 | 8 / 14 | `opencollective/opencollective-frontend` |
| 12 | 0.47 | 144 / 308 | `space-wizards/space-station-14` |
| 15 | 0.36 | 179 / 500 | `is-a-dev/register` |
| 17 | 0.32 | 67 / 210 | `NixOS/nixpkgs` |

**The prediction failed.** We expected `is-a-dev/register` — a registry where
every merged pull request is a one-line domain entry — to rank at or near the
top. It ranked **15th of 22**. Its merge rate is 0.36 because it rejects a large
volume of malformed requests. Writing this up as a confirmed prediction would
have been exactly the unpinned claim this project exists to avoid.

**What actually happened is a stronger result.** L0's top five contains three
registries — `plugin-hub` (#1), `dimension-adapters` (#3), `homebrew-cask` (#5).
Every merged contribution to those is a manifest entry or an adapter stub. Below
them sit the two most plausibly genuine opportunities in the pool:
`space-station-14` at #12 and `NixOS/nixpkgs` at #17. A developer following L0
would try three registries before reaching nixpkgs.

So the failure mode is real and systematic — registries cluster at the top,
software projects sit mid-pack — but it is a *category* effect, not the single
repository we had named in advance. One cherry-picked example replaced by a
pattern across four independent repositories is better evidence, not worse.

**Also observed.** Two repositories score 0.00 across 500 attempts:
`SecureBananaLabs/bug-bounty` and `google-test/signclav2-probe-repo`. Maximum
inbound activity, nothing merged. `NousResearch/hermes-agent` sits at 0.02 over
445 attempts. These are the opposite failure — repositories whose GitHub surface
looks extremely busy and which accept essentially nothing.

**Decision.** Kept as the baseline label. L1 must separate merges that touch real
source from merges that append a line to a data file; that is the discriminator
the top of this table is missing.

**Known limitation, recorded now.** Three repositories hit the 500 pull request
page cap (`is-a-dev/register`, `SecureBananaLabs/bug-bounty`,
`google-test/signclav2-probe-repo`), so their figures are the most recent 500
attempts rather than a census. `is-a-dev/register` is one of them, which means
its true rank is measured on a sample. Raising the cap before L1 is on the list.
